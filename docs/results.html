      The box plot shows separability of standard netflix subscription price between three clusters
       of countries (c1, c2 and c3). Mean value for c2 is pretty different than c1 and there is some difference 
       with c3 as well.

      Anova test showed there is significant difference in standard price 
      for different clusters of countries. We got p value of 1.281e-07 which is super low (significance level 0.05) showing there is a 
      significant difference in values of standard netflix price for different clusters of countries.

      We used regression model to identify the relationship between
      income of a country and Netflix standard subscription price and number of subscribers for different countries across the world.
     Below is the summary of the results from the regression model for income and standard cost.

  <p>
    In the figure above we can see we got a p value of  1.579e -7.
    We got this result while controlling for the country's gdp, population, population density and inflation.
    The lower p value shows that average income of a country affects netflix standard subscription price 
    in a significant way. 

    However, the R squared value of 0.5 shows there is not strong correlation between Income and standard
    Netflix subscription price. 
    <!-- Also, we can observe that the coefficient for Income is in order of e-4 whic is  very low. This 
    indicates that for every one unit increase in susbscription  -->

    In the figure above we can see we got a p value of 0.2291
    We got this result while controlling for the country's gdp, population, population density and inflation.
    The p value shows that average income of a country doesn't affect netflix subscribers
    in a significant way. 

    Also, the R squared value of 0.03855 shows there is not much correlation between Income and 
    Netflix subscribers.

    From the figure we can see that a tree of depth 7 can perfectly classify four categories of standard
    Netflix subscription price (Very Low, Low, High and Vey High). Furthermore, <b>"Income"</b> variable in the root level
    shows it has highest gain. We can get various useful insights from this diagram like, 
    if income is greater than 23100 and population is greater that 7147553, then that country belongs to <b>"High"</b>
    standard subscription price category.

        Average AQI is determined by averaging the AQI values from 2015-2019 for each county. Below table gives more information about mean AQI values for low and high income counties. 
    </p>
    <p>
        From the table we can say that both low-income and medium/high-income counties have almost the same mean AQI. It is surprising to see that mean for the number of days with moderate AQI and mean for the number of days with unhealthy AQI is less than medium/high income counties.

      <h2>AQI and median household income</h2>

        We use an ordinary least regression model to identify the relationship between AQI and median income for 1,832 counties in the United States. Below is the summary of the results from the regression model for AQI and median Income.

     <p>From the above results,  a p-value of 0.000 means we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant relationship between the income of a county and the median AQI level of that county. However, the R-squared value of 0.016 says that there is no strong linear correlation between AQI and median household income. We can observe that the coefficient for median income is very low (in the order of e-5). This indicates that for every one unit increase in AQI, there is 7.814e-05 units increase in median income.  From the below plot of actual vs fitted AQI, we can see there is a slightly downward trend in AQI as the income increases.</p>
