    <p>For significance level of 0.05, i.e., p-value is less than 0.05:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            There is significant relationship between number of days with moderate AQI and median household income and also, 
        </li>
      <li>
        There is significant relationship between the number of days with unhealthy for sensitive groups and median household income of a county 
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    However, low R2 values (~0.016) indicate that there is no strong correlation between AQI and median income. In other words, income has no correlation with exposure to different AQI
    From the results, we cannot jump into the conclusion that low-income communities are proportionally impacted by air pollution   
  </p> 
<h2>Limitations</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Analysis is done across county level. Fine-grained analysis like neighborhood level can reveal actual relationship between income and exposure to AQI</li>
      <li>Around 43% of counties have no AQI data. Our analysis might be impacted for this reason.</li>
      <li>Results might be impacted due to transportation of pollutants between different communities</li>
</ol> 
<h2>Future Scope</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In the future, researchers can analyze how variations in air quality can affect mortality rate (specifically deaths caused due to cardiovascular or respiratory diseases) across different socio-economic status.</li>
    <li>Comparison can be made for different time periods 2010-2015 vs 2015-2020, i.e., one can verify whether the improvement in median household income level of a county improves AQI in that county over time.</li>
