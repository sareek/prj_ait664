  <h2 class="title">Brief Overview</h2>  
  <p>
    The goal of this project is to identify the
     relationship between average income of a country and netflix standard subscription cost as well as number
     of netflix subscribers for that country.  
  </p>

  <p>
   Furthermore, we are aiming to find which countries are similar to each other in terms of library size, 
   tv shows, movie shows,   netflix subscribers count, 
   and subscription fee, while also taking into account country’s gdp, income and population

    Air Pollution is one of the major challenges faced by urban cities and towns caused mainly due to industrial and vehicular emissions, 
    uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels, and excessive use of Heating Ventilating Air Conditioning (HVAC)
    systems.
  
  It has direct efect on human, animal and plants health.
  Studies have found pollution kills most infants in poorer and developing countries.
   WHO has said that every year, exposure to air pollution is estimated to cause seven million
    premature deaths. Mostly, people who belong to the vulnerable group with respiratory illness 
    like asthma, or infants or people with lower immunity are at more risk of death due to air pollution.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Economic factors such as income and poverty level
    are related to exposure of people with polluted air. 
     Hence, people with lower economic status are more likely to become the victim of air pollution.

<!-- <h1>Why is the study important?</h1>
  <p>
    Consumption of polluted air leads to harmful effects on the health of people.
     While there is no doubt about that, it is also important to plan for a better economy,
      education and other socio economic factors. Now the question is while aiming to speed up 
      economic growth should we be cautious about the effects of these activities on the environment.
       It is known that industrial processes emit huge amounts of organic compounds carbon monoxide, 
       hydrocarbons, and chemicals into the air. These pollutants are reasons for global warming and
        greenhouse effect in the air. Burning gas, coal and oil results in three times as many deaths as 
        road traffic accidents worldwide and it is estimated that air pollution has a $2.9 trillion 
        economic cost, equating to 3.3 percent of the world’s GDP. 
  </p>

   <p>
    So various socio-economic factors contribute to the increase in air pollution and also
     we can find some patterns in levels of air pollution based on socio economic factors.
   </p>
   <p> This study of understanding relationship between
    socio-economic factors and exposure to air pollution is important because
    it helps in more in-detail understanding of how socio economic factors are related 
    with air pollution that can help autorities to come up with an appropriate plan for 
    sustainable developmental activities.
   </p>
   <p>
     Air pollution affects people and society in numerous ways.
     People with lower socio-economic status are at even riskier side of getting severely hurt 
     because they are less aware about negative effects of air pollution and
     have limited resources for proper health care.

   <!-- <p>
    Some well known impacts of air pollution includes, 
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li><b>Impacts of residents</b></li>
    <p>
     Tiny particles in atmosphere can easily penetrate through human respiratory system and cause damage to cardiovascular system.
     It has both short as well as long-term impacts on human health.</p>
    <li><b>Impacts on local farmers</b></li>
      <p>
        It reduces crop yields and life of plants.
      </p>
    <li><b>Impacts on global climate</b></li>
     <p>
        Green house gases present in the atmosphere is strongly linked to sea level rise and global warming.
     </p>
    <li><b>Impacts on aviation agencies</b></li>
     <p>
        Reduced visibility causes flight cancellations, diversions, and delays in reaching destinations.
     </p>
    <li><b>Impacts on economy</b></li>
    <p>
        Costs related to human health increase and productivity decreases due to poor health of people.
