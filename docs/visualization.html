  <h1>Visualization</h1>
  <p>We used QGIS for the world map visualization and used the data we collected along with it 
    for doing Exploratory data analysis. QGIS is an open-source cross-platform desktop geographic 
    information system application that supports viewing, editing, printing, and analysis of 
    geospatial data. </p>

  <!-- <h1>Data visualization</h1>
  <p>We use the United States county shape file for visualization and exploratory data analysis. Shape file can be downloaded from

      Figure below shows distribution of various income levels in the United States. Blue colored counties represent low median household income whereas, red colored counties represent medium/high household income.
      From the figure we can say that both low-income and high-income counties are evenly distributed across US. 
    </p>

  </div>
<p> From the above figure, we can observe that the majority of counties have AQI below 54, which falls under good AQI. Moderate AQI and unhealthy for sensitive groups AQI is mostly seen among the counties in the state of California.</p>

  </div>
  <p>From the above figure, we can observe that the majority of counties fall under the second group of income level i.e income greater than 47,000$ and less than 71,000$ (approx.). There are very few counties that lie in the fifth group (> 1,18,000$).</p>

  </div>
  <p>
    From the above plots, we can see that median AQI decreases during the period 2015-2019. This means AQI is better now when compared to previous years (good to know). This trend can be explained from the second and third plot. It is evident that the number of days with good AQI increases with time whereas, the number of days with moderate AQI decreases, which is why we see improvement in overall median AQI (first plot) during 2015-2019.
